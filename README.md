# bushes_soil

When this minetest mod is installed, harvesting fruit from a bush makes bushes around it fail (become dry shrub). Maybe in the future the soil quality will be determined in a better way. This mod reduces the issue of people having hundreds of fruit bushes.

## Requirements
* default
* bushes (such as from plantlife_modpack)
