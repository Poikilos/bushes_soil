# bushes_soil

When this minetest mod is installed, harvesting fruit from a bush makes bushes around it fail (in 5x5 area, other bushes become `default:dry_shrub`).

## Purpose
This mod reduces fallout from people having hundreds of fruit bushes (since bushes mod allows harvesting multiple bushes from one by chance, even an immature fruitless bush; also, allows planting on any node).

## Project Status
Maybe in the future the soil quality will be determined in a better way, but you should probably fork it if you need any changes. For now, I have no need to change or update this mod as it serves its intended purpose.

## Requirements
* default
* bushes (such as from plantlife_modpack)
